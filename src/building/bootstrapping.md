# Bootstrapping the Compiler

This subchapter is about the bootstrapping process.

## What is bootstrapping? How does it work?

[Bootstrapping] is the process of using a compiler to compile itself.
More accurately, it means using an older compiler to compile a newer version
of the same compiler.

This raises a chicken-and-egg paradox: where did the first compiler come from?
It must have been written in a different language. In Rust's case it was
[written in OCaml][ocaml-compiler]. However it was abandoned long ago and the
only way to build a modern version of rustc is a slightly less modern
version.

This is exactly how `x.py` works: it downloads the current `beta` release of
rustc, then uses it to compile the new compiler. The beta release is
called `stage0` and the newly built compiler is `stage1` (or `stage0
artifacts`). To get the full benefits of the new compiler (e.g. optimizations
and new features), the `stage1` compiler then compiles _itself_ again. This
last compiler is called `stage2` (or `stage1 artifacts`).

The `stage2` compiler is the one distributed with `rustup` and all other
install methods. However, it takes a very long time to build because one must
first build the new compiler with an older compiler and then use that to
build the new compiler with itself. For development, you usually only want
the `stage1` compiler: `x.py build --stage 1 library/std`.

## Complications of bootstrapping

Since the build system uses the current beta compiler to build the stage-1
bootstrapping compiler, the compiler source code can't use some features
until they reach beta (because otherwise the beta compiler doesn't support
them). On the other hand, for [compiler intrinsics][intrinsics] and internal
features, the features _have_ to be used. Additionally, the compiler makes
heavy use of nightly features (`#![feature(...)]`). How can we resolve this
problem?

There are two methods used:
1. The build system sets `--cfg bootstrap` when building with `stage0`, so we
can use `cfg(not(bootstrap))` to only use features when built with `stage1`.
This is useful for e.g. features that were just stabilized, which require
`#![feature(...)]` when built with `stage0`, but not for `stage1`.
2. The build system sets `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`. This special variable means to
_break the stability guarantees_ of rust: Allow using `#![feature(...)]` with
a compiler that's not nightly. This should never be used except when
bootstrapping the compiler.

## Contributing to bootstrap

When you use the bootstrap system, you'll call it through `x.py`.
However, most of the code lives in `src/bootstrap`.
`bootstrap` has a difficult problem: it is written in Rust, but yet it is run
before the rust compiler is built! To work around this, there are two
components of bootstrap: the main one written in rust, and `bootstrap.py`.
`bootstrap.py` is what gets run by x.py. It takes care of downloading the
`stage0` compiler, which will then build the bootstrap binary written in
Rust.

Because there are two separate codebases behind `x.py`, they need to
be kept in sync. In particular, both `bootstrap.py` and the bootstrap binary
parse `config.toml` and read the same command line arguments. `bootstrap.py`
keeps these in sync by setting various environment variables, and the
programs sometimes to have add arguments that are explicitly ignored, to be
read by the other.

### Adding a setting to config.toml

This section is a work in progress. In the meantime, you can see an example
contribution [here][bootstrap-build].

## Stages of bootstrap

This is a detailed look into the separate bootstrap stages. When running
`x.py` you will see output such as:

<img alt="A diagram of the rustc compilation phases" src="../img/rustc_stages.svg" class="center" />

Keep in mind this diagram is a simplification, i.e. `rustdoc` can be built at
different stages, the process is a bit different when passing flags such as
`--keep-stage`, or if there are non-host targets.

The following tables indicate the outputs of various stage actions:

`--stage=2` stops here.

Note that the convention `x.py` uses is that:
- A "stage N artifact" is an artifact that is _produced_ by the stage N compiler.
- The "stage (N+1) compiler" is assembled from "stage N artifacts".
- A `--stage N` flag means build _with_ stage N.

In short, _stage 0 uses the stage0 compiler to create stage0 artifacts which
will later be uplifted to stage1_.

Every time any of the main artifacts (`std` and `rustc`) are compiled, two
steps are performed.
When `std` is compiled by a stage N compiler, that `std` will be linked to
programs built by the stage N compiler (including `rustc` built later
on). It will also be used by the stage (N+1) compiler to link against itself.
This is somewhat intuitive if one thinks of the stage (N+1) compiler as "just"
another program we are building with the stage N compiler. In some ways, `rustc`
(the binary, not the `rustbuild` step) could be thought of as one of the few
`no_core` binaries out there.

So "stage0 std artifacts" are in fact the output of the downloaded stage0
compiler, and are going to be used for anything built by the stage0 compiler:
e.g. `rustc` artifacts. When it announces that it is "building stage1
std artifacts" it has moved on to the next bootstrapping phase. This pattern
continues in latter stages.

Also note that building host `std` and target `std` are different based on the
stage (e.g. see in the table how stage2 only builds non-host `std` targets.
This is because during stage2, the host `std` is uplifted from the "stage 1"
`std` -- specifically, when "Building stage 1 artifacts" is announced, it is
later copied into stage2 as well (both the compiler's `libdir` and the
`sysroot`).

This `std` is pretty much necessary for any useful work with the compiler.
Specifically, it's used as the `std` for programs compiled by the newly compiled
compiler (so when you compile `fn main() { }` it is linked to the last `std`
compiled with `x.py build --stage 1 library/std`).

The `rustc` generated by the stage0 compiler is linked to the freshly-built
`std`, which means that for the most part only `std` needs to be cfg-gated,
so that `rustc` can use featured added to std immediately after their addition,
without need for them to get into the downloaded beta. The `std` built by the
`stage1/bin/rustc` compiler, also known as "stage1 std artifacts", is not
necessarily ABI-compatible with that compiler.
That is, the `rustc` binary most likely could not use this `std` itself.
It is however ABI-compatible with any programs that the `stage1/bin/rustc`
binary builds (including itself), so in that sense they're paired.

This is also where `--keep-stage 1 library/std` comes into play. Since most
changes to the compiler don't actually change the ABI, once you've produced a
`std` in stage 1, you can probably just reuse it with a different compiler.
If the ABI hasn't changed, you're good to go, no need to spend the time
recompiling that `std`.
`--keep-stage` simply assumes the previous compile is fine and copies those
artifacts into the appropriate place, skipping the cargo invocation.

The reason we first build `std`, then `rustc`, is largely just
because we want to minimize `cfg(stage0)` in the code for `rustc`.
Currently `rustc` is always linked against a "new" `std` so it doesn't
ever need to be concerned with differences in std; it can assume that the std is
as fresh as possible.

The reason we need to build it twice is because of ABI compatibility.
The beta compiler has it's own ABI, and then the `stage1/bin/rustc` compiler
will produce programs/libraries with the new ABI.
We used to build three times, but because we assume that the ABI is constant
within a codebase, we presume that the libraries produced by the "stage2"
compiler (produced by the `stage1/bin/rustc` compiler) is ABI-compatible with
the `stage1/bin/rustc` compiler's produced libraries.
What this means is that we can skip that final compilation -- and simply use the
same libraries as the `stage2/bin/rustc` compiler uses itself for programs it
links against.

This `stage2/bin/rustc` compiler is shipped to end-users, along with the
`stage 1 {std,rustc}` artifacts.

## Passing stage-specific flags to `rustc`

`x.py` allows you to pass stage-specific flags to `rustc` when bootstrapping.
The `RUSTFLAGS_STAGE_0`, `RUSTFLAGS_STAGE_1` and `RUSTFLAGS_STAGE_2`
environment variables pass the given flags when building stage 0, 1, and 2
artifacts respectively.

Additionally, the `RUSTFLAGS_STAGE_NOT_0` variable, as its name suggests, pass
the given arguments if the stage is not 0.

## Environment Variables

During bootstrapping, there are a bunch of compiler-internal environment
variables that are used. If you are trying to run an intermediate version of
`rustc`, sometimes you may need to set some of these environment variables
manually. Otherwise, you get an error like the following:

```text
thread 'main' panicked at 'RUSTC_STAGE was not set: NotPresent', library/core/result.rs:1165:5
```

If `./stageN/bin/rustc` gives an error about environment variables, that
usually means something is quite wrong -- or you're trying to compile e.g.
`librustc` or `std` or something that depends on environment variables. In
the unlikely case that you actually need to invoke rustc in such a situation,
you can find the environment variable values by adding the following flag to
your `x.py` command: `--on-fail=print-env`.
