The new-style trait solver is based on the work done in [chalk][chalk]. Chalk
recasts Rust's trait system explicitly in terms of logic programming. It does
this by "lowering" Rust code into a kind of logic program we can then execute
queries against.

The key observation here is that the Rust trait system is basically a
kind of logic, and it can be mapped onto standard logical inference
rules. We can then look for solutions to those inference rules in a
very similar fashion to how e.g. a [Prolog] solver works. It turns out
that we can't *quite* use Prolog rules (also called Horn clauses) but
rather need a somewhat more expressive variant.

You can read more about chalk itself in the
[Chalk book](https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/) section.

## Ongoing work
The design of the new-style trait solving currently happens in two places:

**chalk**. The [chalk][chalk] repository is where we experiment with new ideas
and designs for the trait system.

**rustc**. Once we are happy with the logical rules, we proceed to
implementing them in rustc. This mainly happens in
[`librustc_traits`][librustc_traits]. We map our struct, trait, and impl declarations
into logical inference rules in the [lowering module in rustc](./lowering-module.md).
