# ICE-breakers

The **ICE-breaker groups** are an easy way to help out with rustc in a
"piece-meal" fashion, without committing to a larger project.
ICE-breaker groups are **[easy to join](#join)** (just submit a PR!)
and joining does not entail any particular commitment.

Once you [join an ICE ICE-breaker group](#join), you will be added to
a list that receives pings on github whenever a new issue is found
that fits the ICE-breaker group's criteria. If you are interested, you
can then [claim the issue] and start working on it.

Of course, you don't have to wait for new issues to be tagged! If you
prefer, you can use the Github label for an ICE-breaker group to
search for existing issues that haven't been claimed yet.

## What issues are a good fit for ICE-breaker groups?

"ICE-breaker issues" are intended to be **isolated** bugs of **middle
priority**:

- By **isolated**, we mean that we do not expect large-scale refactoring
  to be required to fix the bug.
- By **middle priority**, we mean that we'd like to see the bug fixed,
  but it's not such a burning problem that we are dropping everything
  else to fix it. The danger with such bugs, of course, is that they
  can accumulate over time, and the role of the ICE-breaker groups is
  to try and stop that from happening!

## Joining an ICE-breaker group

TBD -- we are building this mechanism right now! In the meantime, drop
in on Zulip and leave your github name in [this topic][topic].
