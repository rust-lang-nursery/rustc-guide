# Part 3: The Compiler Frontend

This part of the guide looks at the compiler frontend (with the major exception
of the type system, which is in the next part). This part describes the process
of taking raw source code from the user and transforming it into various forms
that the compiler can work with easily. These are called intermediate
representations.
